# Task Management App - Aishwarya

This is a React + Vite app, displaying a list of tasks whose state is managed by redux-toolkit & react-redux.

- Node Version -> v18.17.0
- React Version -> v18.3.1

## Features
- Implemented create, edit and delete tasks functionality and maintained state of tasks using redux-toolkit.
- Implemented a way to persist tasks between page reloads using local storage.
- The application has a clean and user-friendly interface. Used CSS for styling throughout.

## How to run the app
- Clone the repository. 
- Run ```npm i```, followed by ```npm run dev``` in the terminal to run the app.

## Assumptions
- By default, the status of the task will be *Pending*.
- The app is designed for mobile users. Preferably, choose the iPhone 14 Pro Max device (430 x 932).
- On hover, the ```edit``` and ```delete``` buttons should be visible. On a web app, hover works but for a mobile device, a click is needed to view these buttons.
